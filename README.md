This 42 school project is about designing and implementing an algorithm to solve a special case of a maximum flow problem in graph theory. The goal is to find the optimal flow of ants through an anthill that minimizes the number of rounds needed to traverse the anthill. An anthill is described as a network composed of 'rooms' (graph nodes) and 'tunnels' (edges) linking the rooms together, with all ants starting and finishing at two precise rooms. The real trouble begins when each room can welcome only one ant at a time (except for the start and end rooms). A round ends when no more ants are able to start or move any further in the anthill.
